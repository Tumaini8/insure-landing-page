            My name is Kieffer Edgar, but I work under the name Shawn Kieffer.
            My African story, and the story of my life, is full of complex and
            beautiful moments. In my career as a professional photographer, I
            devote myself to capturing these moments of complex beauty, frame by
            frame. My own story begins with that of my parents - My parents met
            after my mom had just finished high school in Dar es salaam and they
            got married 5 years later. The funny thing is that my dad's older
            brother married my mom's older sister- that's actually how they met.
            Some people claim that this was an arranged marriage. In all
            honesty, I am not sure how much truth there is to this and in the
            end all that matters to me is that this marriage is the reason I now
            exist. My father, Edgar Lutofyo is a medical engineer and my mother
            Tamaly Edgar works in Dar es Salaam Disability hospital.

              and photographing Beyonce during her Formation World Tour</em
            >
            <br />
            <br />
            Each of my parents are observant people who, throughout my life,
            have been able to glean the simple, essential truths from their own
            experiences and pass them on to me in the form of wisdom. It would
            be impossible to recount all of the lessons I've inherited from my
            parents, as they have been, without a doubt, the sturdiest and most
            consistent guiding forces in my life.

            As I've grown into adulthood, however, I've come to especially
            appreciate the way my parents taught me to value simplicity, as well
            as how to carefully observe my life, in order to choose the right
            goal at the right time. These are the teachings that have helped me
            embrace a life of balance, freedom, joy and self-determination.

              Beyond myself and the legacy of my own creative career, I have
              hopes for Tanzania. I believe we've lost some sense of community
              in this ultra-independent, hyper-individualist social era. If we
              were more connected and caring, if families were stronger, if we
              valued one another more, many of our widespread social issues
              would disappear.</em

              In Tanzania, as in all of Africa, I'd like to see more honesty.
              I'd like to see that the riches of the continent are shared, and,
              along with this I'd love to see a strengthening of democracy, and
              an overall reconciliation between all of the different tribes,
              languages, and cultures that make Africa truly wealthy. I believe
              that only once this reconciliation is achieved can we unleash
              Africa's great potential, while coming to terms with the
              complexities of its past and present, in order to pursue its
              future.
